  \section{ Criteria }
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Space and time complexity (e.g. big O)
    \item Future Prediction Accuracy
    \item Historical Recreation Accuracy
    \item Efficiency of Stroage
    \item offline vs online learning
    \item feasibility of use with a multi-robot system

    \item meta-information
    \begin{itemize}
      \item availability of work (e.g. libraries or source code)
      \item implementation compelxity
      \item suitable fields of application
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}



  \section{ How to use this criteria }
  TODO discussion and table goes here
