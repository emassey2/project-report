      I would like to firstly thank my advisors who have enabled me to achieve
      this landmark in my academic career. Without their unending guidance and
      encouragement this project would not have been possible.

      To my friends and family, I extended a warm and heartfelt thank you. Your
      emotional support was invaluable. Specifically, I'd like to mention
      my girlfriend Megan for her love and continued understanding while
      pursuing this work. Lastly, a special shout out to Sam and Dylan, along
      with Megan, for your time spent proofreading and correcting the earlier
      revisions of this work.

      Special thanks to Dr. Tomas Krajnik, not only for your contributions to
      the field, but to this work specifically. Thank you for providing access
      to an early version of your work and its respective code. Your help
      as well as your warmth and friendliness won't be forgotten.

      Finally, I'd like to extend my thanks to all my educators, past and present,
      who have contributed to my academic and professional career.
