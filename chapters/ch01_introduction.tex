\chapter{ Introduction }

Moving logistics from point A to point B is an extremely common task in a
wide variety of domains spanning industrial, commercial, and even
residential applications. Robots, or automatically guided vehicles (AVGs),
have commonly been used in industrial settings for a few decades already,
but have been relegated to a discrete and limited set of predictable tasks.
AVGs human counterparts are still the backbone and glue that holds a
logistical network together. This is especially true when logistics must
be transported through a particularly dynamic or human environment.\\

The relegation of AVGs to a limited number of tasks and environments can
be attributed to their lack of flexibility and 'common sense'. Often AVGs
are provided with a static model of their operating environment, also
known as a world model, which is unable to account for the dynamic nature
of an environment built for, and used by, humans. Humans, on the other
hand, are excellent are deriving patterns from past experiences and have
the innate ability to use this pattern recognition to improve and optimize
future work and path planning. In order to improve the efficiency of
current AVGs and to expand their ability to operate in a more diverse set
of domains, it would be desirable to include these human-like predictive
qualities into an AVG.\\

Recent work into this area of study has already begun, and is showing great
promise. Although the field is still fairly new, a variety of methods have
been introduced to allow for an AVG to observe and make predictions about
it's environment. It is for this reason that a method, or set of criteria,
be devised for comparing and contrasting the variety of solutions. The
analysis of these methods will not only allow for others to choose the most
fitting approach for a given environment, but also expose deficiencies in
the current approaches and guide future research efforts. Improvements in
this field will ultimately result in more flexible AVGs that can operate
in a wider variety of environments and for longer periods of autonomy.


\section{ Challenges and Difficulties }

Historically, world modeling techniques could be thought of as simply a mapping
and path planning problem in either two dimensional or three dimensional space.
These problems have been studied for decades and thus there exist a handful of
well known solutions, each with there own advantages and disadvantages. However,
with the fairly recent introduction of the fourth dimension, time, into the
equation there has been the introduction of a number of different methods. \\

The early and simplistic approaches to introducing temporal components into
world models started as early as 2002 \cite{Arbuckle2002}
but within the past decade or so there has been an uptick
both in the number of different approaches and the complexity of the methods.
\cite{Krajnik2017} [TODO ADD OTHER CITATIONS]
With this increase in complexity and variety of approaches combined with a
lack of historical perspective and analysis, it can be daunting task to select
the 'correct' or even a well fitting spatio-temporal world model for a new
project.


\section{ Motivation }

With so many different methods and no historical knowledge or method of comparision
this paper aims to provide a template for comparing existing models that should
be extensible to account for the inevitable release of future methods. To that
aim the following goals shall be met:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Summary of the major existing spatio-temporal world modeling techniques.

  \item Collection of performance measurement or other comparison techniques as
    defined by the papers themselves.

  \item Introduction of meta-information in order to better compare the existing
    world modeling techniques

  \item A quick and easy to use table for high level overview and comparison of techniques

  \item Example application of the aforementioned information to select a fitting
    technique for a real-world application

  \item Subsequent evaluation and discussion on the appropriateness of technique
    selected, especially with respect to the introduced meta-information

\end{itemize}

It is with this collection of existing comparison techniques, new meta-information,
and a tangible example that other projects may be able to more easily evaluate
and select the best fitting spatio-temporal world modeling technique for the
project. Additionally, when new spatio-temporal world model techniques are
introduced, it should be with relative easy that their information be integrated
into this method for comparative analysis for future use.



\section{ Problem Formulation }

In order to best choose between preexisting solutions for spatio-temporal
world modeling and guide future development it is vital comparative criteria be
established. This comparative analysis will set out to clarify and quantify
these approaches. Although the comparative analysis will be general enough to be
applicable for any project wanting to incorporate spatio-temporal wold modeling,
it will ultimately be viewed through the lens of a specific real-world application
with a focus in long-term planning. More details about the specific application
will be discussed later however, it is important to note that viewing the
various modeling methods through the lens of real-world application is quite
powerful. \\

Improvements in world modeling, specifically within the domain of
spatio-temporal world modeling, have already yielded significant effects
on the performance of robotic logistic systems. These improvements directly
translate into decreases in travel time as well as increases in reliability
that hinges on knowing what areas to avoid a what times. These improvements in
turn create a much more powerful and scaleable logistics network with less
downtime. This  ultimately leads to more goods being delivered which saves
both time and money, and in the case of hospitals, possibly lives. \\

Despite all of these benefits, and the numerous number of different approaches
for spatio-temporal world modeling, there currently lacks any method for
accurately comparing and contrasting the different approaches. It is with this
in mind that this thesis will collect, describe, compare, and contrast these
approaches.  It will use the preexisting criteria already available when possible as some,
but not necessarily all, of the work includes basic performance statistics.
Furthermore, in work where these criteria are not mentioned explicitly, or are
not otherwise available, an attempt to derive the information either via
calculation or collected via simulation. Lastly, new criteria will be devised
or otherwise assigned to allow account for information desired and not provided
or other meta-information that would aid in comparing these methods. \\

Finally, an example study will be included which will attempt to select the
best-suited approach for a real-world scenario, known as ROPOD. The real-world
scenario in question involves moving logistics internally within a hospital.
It consists of a central server in charge of planning and routing multiple
robots.  Additionally, it will be assumed planning will be done with
OpenStreetMap and thus will use a graph-based approach. More details and
specifics about this project will be discussed in a later section. \\
